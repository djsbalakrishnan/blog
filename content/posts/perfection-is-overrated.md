I have a confession to make, I have been writing and re-writing this post for over two months now. During this interim, the blog's title has changed thrice and the blog content has changed so much that the initial draft is nowhere close to this post. Having said this, you might be wondering why, and I don't blame you for it. After all, this has been a real pain point for me and at one point I thought this is impossible for me to accomplish. Trust me, by the end of this post you will get to know why it took so long for me in the first place, but, if you are in the same boat as I was, I hope this will give you a reason to break out of this vicious infinite loop. 

Being a millennial, I got introduced to the internet early in my life. Using it initially I really did not understand and appreciate its importance, and to be honest I found it to be rather distractive and addictive. Maybe it was because of my upbringing, or maybe I did not spend enough time to understand its potential. However, everything changed when I got my laptop and got access to high-speed internet connectivity. I began to use the internet every day consuming content from blogs, youtube, and podcasts. This proved to be a game-changer for me because now I could listen to the world's best minds with a click of a button. This gave me an opportunity to improve myself in ways that I could not have imagined. In case you are wondering how does any of this relates to my capability of publishing a single blog, well, here is the thing. As much as I love the internet for its enormous benefits, it was making me doubt my capabilities as a content creator. Every time I consume quality content, more often than not, I end up comparing myself with the other creator. And as you might have already guessed, I did not stand a chance against these amazing content creators. 

Adding to what I have mentioned earlier, my desire to be a perfectionist had caused even more destruction. I so badly wanted my first blog to be the pinnacle of my writing that I had postponed it for a long time. I had spent a lot of time finding the perfect topic, the perfect introduction, the perfect examples, and the perfect conclusion that ironically I ended up writing this blog on practice over perfection. Moreover, to top it all, I was not willing to fail. I wanted my first blog to be celebrated by the creators that I look up to. After all, you only get one chance to make your first impression. 

However as you can see now, I have published my first blog. I have moved past the hiccups that I have mentioned above. Don't take me wrong, I still want all of those things but, firstly, I realized that the idealogy of perfection leads to stagnation. In simple terms, you stop looking for improvements if you have produced your perfect content. In the same vein, I can also add that the best content creators exist because they have continued to practice and did not fear failure. I cannot help but wonder what took me so long to realize this, after all the ignitors of enlightenment (if I can call this an enlightenment) are always small.  

In conclusion, for all those who are currently working on your perfect first blog, I hope this gives you a reason to start. To make it even more compelling for you, I want to end this blog by committing myself to write at least one blog every fortnight to help myself get over the fear and in that process end up becoming a better content creator than I was yesterday. I hope you would join me on this journey. 

Cheers!
